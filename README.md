# Homework 2: Skiplists and Hash Tables
# CS 201 Data Structures II, Spring 2020

-------

This homework explores skiplists and hash tables through implementation and through conceptual problems.

A partial implementation of Conway's Game of Life is provided. It has to be completed by implementing different hash tables that use chaining and linear probing for conflict resolution.

Insight into skiplists is developed and probed through conceptual questions.

A bonus questions demonstrates the efficiency of skiplists by using them to implement an unordered set to be used in a text search application.

## Purpose

This homework provides insight into hash tables and skiplists. In some cases, this is achieved by asking you to implement the structure. In others, through asking you to think about slight variations to the default structure. 

## Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand the structure skiplists 
- understand the operations supported by skiplists, especially *find_predecessor()*.
- understand hashing and hash tables
- understand conflicts and conflict resolution strategies in hash tables
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in a high level language, preferably python
- be able to problem solve

## The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw2.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Time Requirement.

Based on feedback from the last set of students that attempted this assignment, the number of hours that your team will require to complete this homework are as follows.
- _data unavailable_

## Grading

Grading will be as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _rubric.csv_.

## Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any one part will result in loss of marks.

### 1.1 Solving the Problem Set

Please solve the problems as indicated in the problem set and push the relevant files to your GitHub repository. Any files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. As your code submission will be partly graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

Deadline: 1830h on Fri, 21 Feb

### 1.2 Feedback

You have to provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the form at [LMS -> Tests & Quizzes](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/jliIIV). This is due around the same time as the problem solutions.

Deadline: 1845h on Fri, 21 Feb

### 1.3 Peer Review

You will review 2 submissions which will be shared with you through [LMS -> Drop Box](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/4MonbN). The peer review rubric will be shared through [LMS -> Assignments](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/x0KvOt) where the review will have to be submitted.

Deadline: 1830h on Mon, 24 Feb
